8. Your team wants to gradually roll out a new version of an application to a subset of users for testing before fully deploying it. How would you implement a canary deployment in Kubernetes?
9. In the event of a cluster failure or outage, how would you ensure timely recovery and minimal data loss for applications running in Kubernetes?
10. Your organization wants to prevent resource contention and ensure fair resource allocation across different teams or projects in the Kubernetes cluster. How would you implement resource quotas and limits?
11. Your team needs visibility into the performance and health of applications running in Kubernetes. How would you implement application observability?
12. Your organization follows the immutable infrastructure paradigm and wants to ensure that all changes to application deployments are versioned and reproducible. How would you implement immutable infrastructure in Kubernetes?
13. Your organization operates in multiple geographic regions and wants to deploy applications closer to end-users for reduced latency and improved performance. How would you implement geo-distributed deployments in Kubernetes?
14. Your organization has workloads running on-premises and in public cloud environments and wants to adopt Kubernetes for workload portability. How would you implement hybrid cloud deployments with Kubernetes?
15. Your organization operates in a regulated industry and needs to ensure compliance with security and privacy regulations for applications running in Kubernetes. How would you implement compliance and governance?
