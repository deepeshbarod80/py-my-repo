# Basic: Mastering Terraform Interview Questions:
1. What is Terraform, and how does it differ from other infrastructure as code tools?
2. Explain the concept of "declarative syntax" in Terraform and how it contributes to infrastructure management.
3. What are the key components of a Terraform configuration file?
4. How does Terraform maintain state, and why is state management important in infrastructure as code?
5. Describe the process of initializing a Terraform project. What does the terraform init command do?
6. What is a Terraform provider, and how does it facilitate interactions with different infrastructure platforms?
7. Explain the purpose of the terraform plan command. What information does it provide, and why is it valuable?
8. How does Terraform handle dependencies between resources, and what is the significance of the Terraform graph?
9. What is the difference between Terraform's "provisioners" and "remote-exec" provisioner?
10. How can you manage sensitive information, such as API keys, in Terraform configurations securely?
11. What are Terraform workspaces, and how can they be useful in managing multiple environments or configurations?
12. Explain the concept of "Terraform modules" and how they contribute to code reusability and maintainability.
13. How does Terraform handle updates or changes to existing infrastructure? What is the purpose of the terraform apply command?
14. What is the significance of Terraform providers' version constraints, and how can they be managed in a Terraform configuration?
15. Describe scenarios in which you might use Terraform "remote backends" and the advantages they bring to state management.

# Scenario-Based: Mastering Terraform Interview Questions
1. You have an existing infrastructure on AWS, and you need to use Terraform to manage it. How would you import these resources into your Terraform configuration?
2. You are working with multiple environments (e.g., dev, prod) and want to avoid duplicating code. How would you structure your Terraform configurations to achieve code reuse?
3. Describe a situation where you might need to use the terraform remote backend, and what advantages does it offer in state management?
4. You need to create a highly available architecture in AWS using Terraform. Explain how you would implement an Auto Scaling Group with load balancing.
5. Your team is adopting a multi-cloud strategy, and you need to manage resources on both AWS and Azure using Terraform. How would you structure your Terraform code to handle this?
6. You want to run specific scripts after provisioning resources with Terraform. How would you achieve this, and what provisioners might you use?
7. You are dealing with sensitive information, such as API keys, in your Terraform configuration. What approach would you take to manage these securely?
8. Describe a scenario where you might need to use Terraform workspaces, and how would you structure your project to take advantage of them?
9. You've made changes to your Terraform configuration, and now you want to preview the execution plan before applying the changes. How would you do this?
10. Your team has decided to adopt GitOps practices for managing infrastructure with Terraform. How would you integrate Terraform with version control systems like Git?
11. You need to manage infrastructure secrets, such as database passwords, in your Terraform configuration. What method or provider might you use?
12. Your team wants to ensure that the infrastructure is consistently provisioned across multiple environments. How would you implement a consistent environment configuration?
13. You are tasked with migrating your existing infrastructure from Terraform v0.11 to v0.12. What considerations and steps would you take?
14. Explain a situation where you might need to use terraform taint and what effect it has on resources.
15. Your team is adopting GitLab CI/CD for automating Terraform workflows. Describe how you would structure your CI/CD pipeline for Terraform, including key stages.
